      'The Nike Air Yeezy was developed from 2007 to 2009 by rapper Kanye West, Nike Creative Director Mark Smith and later Nathan Van Hook. Kanye has spoken very highly of Smith as both a collaborator and designer, and Smith has said the same of Kanye, stating that he is "a truly creative talent" and a "natural designer. The design process for the Nike Air Yeezy was long and features dozens of sample colorways and silhouettes. Inspiration behind the line notably include the Air Tech Challenge II, Jordan III and IV. The early prototype of the Air Yeezy had many features that greatly differ from the release version of the shoe. For instance, the midsole and outsole featured what the shoe’s creators referred to as "Death Star" tooling, named for the large spherical shape on the back half of the midsole. The outsole also featured the "Y-print" that was used on the toebox of the three release versions. Also, on the very early prototypes, the shoe used LED lights implanted in the outsole, but after issues with low battery life and cost evaluation, production staff at Nike came to the conclusion that phosphorescent rubber would be used in place of the LED lights',

      'Anticipation around the release of the Nike Air Yeezy 2 started after a Complex Magazine interview with Mark Smith and Kanye West about designing the Nike Air Yeezy, wherein Kanye stated that there were several designs left over from the Air Yeezy design process that could eventually become the Nike Air Yeezy 2.[10] Despite this statement, none of these designs were used for the Air Yeezy 2, and instead, Nathan VanHook sat down with Kanye to design the Yeezy 2.[11] The shoe features much more of an animalistic design inspiration than the original Air Yeezy, sporting a ridged, reptile inspired heel counter and a snake skin inspired design on the quarters. The shoe, like the original Air Yeezy, borrows tooling from other Nike models. The Air Yeezy 2 borrows its sole unit from the popular Nike Air Tech Challenge II tennis model. The shoe also features several references to Egyptian culture, featuring depictions of the god Horus on the tongue and insole, and using Egyptian hieroglyphics that spell out "YZY" under the strap. There were also several design decisions during the making of the Nike Air Yeezy 2 that were a direct response to some of Kanye’s issues with the initial Nike Air Yeezy. Firstly, unnecessary padding along the upper was eliminated, and the shoe was made shorter for greater mobility. Also, the shoe was purposely slimmed down, to create a thinner look on feet and better fit Kanye West’s foot. As with the original Nike Air Yeezy, several sample colorways were created, the most famous of which was the "Kobe" or "Cheetah" Nike Air Yeezy 2 sample which was based on a popular Christmas colorway of the Nike Kobe VII. Aside from the rumored three pairs in existence and the pictures of the aforementioned sample that spread through various sneaker media sources, very little is known about the sample.[14]',

      "Following a series of high-profile teases of the shoe (including rapper Jay Z exclaiming 'Shoutout to my Yeezys, Yeezy 2s' during a March 2012 SXSW performance), Nike announced the Air Yeezy II sneaker on May 29, 2012. Rapper Macklemore was also seen wearing the Nike Air Yeezy 2's during his performance in Times Square, New York on New Year's Eve. Macklemore was also seen throwing the rare sneaker into the crowd. Amid wide anticipation, the shoe was released with 5000 of each color way on June 9, 2012. While sold for a retail price of $245, the shoe gained notoriety for its wildly inflated resale value upwards of $4,000. The Air Yeezy II featured two premier color ways, Solar Red, Pure Platinum, and a third color way of the Air Yeezy II shoes, dubbed the 'Red Octobers', which underwent a surprise release on February 9, 2014. The 'Red Octobers' released exclusively on Nike's website, and sold out within seconds",

      "The ten Nike shoes were deconstructed and redesigned by Virgil Abloh throughout early 2017.[2] The collaboration between the two brands was officially confirmed in late August, however Abloh had been working on the designs since much earlier in the year and teased them throughout.[3] The design process involved Abloh taking each individual shoe, breaking it down with an X-ACTO knife,[4] removing and altering key elements of the shoe. He maintained the foundational silhouette of each shoe, but added small fabrics and panels and relocated parts. Abloh concentrated his design towards editing the stitching and tongues of each of the shoes. Abloh designed each shoe to have a print on the inside of each shoe, reflecting the creative process and location of creation. It was titled 'Off-White for Nike' then a line which included the name of the shoe that had been remodelled and then two lines saying 'Beaverton, Oregon USA' and 'C. 2017'. Beaverton, Oregon, being the location at which these shoes were designed. Abloh also added the name of the main material of the specific shoe to the midsole in bold black quotation marks, a signature trait of Off-White and Abloh. These examples include 'AIR' and 'FOAM'.",

      "Webster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates. In 2008, the duo released their untitled first EP on social networking website Myspace. The following year, Scott and OG Chess, one of Scott's schoolmates, formed the group The Classmates. The Classmates released two projects, with Buddy Rich in 2009 and Cruis'n USA in 2010.[20] Scott mainly handled production work on both projects. The duo remained together until late 2012, when personal conflicts and financial disputes led to the disbandment of the group. After leaving college, Scott moved from Houston to Washington Heights in New York City where Scott began working with friend Mike Waxx, who owned the music website Illroots. After moving to New York, Scott slept on the floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's studio. Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[18] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state.",
